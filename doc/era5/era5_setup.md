# ERA5

How to set up access to ERA5 data from the [Copernicus Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview).

## Creating a CDS account

To download the ERA5 data from the CDS, you'll need to create a [CDS account here](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/user/register).

Once your account has been created, you'll need to set up access to the API by doing the following:

1.  Log into your CDS account and visit [this page](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to).  

2.  Install the API key.  The uppermost code block on the right side will display the api url and your user key.  You will then need to copy these two lines this into a file called _.cdsapirc_ that you will create in your user root folder.
    * For MacOS, you can create _.cdsapirc_ by opening a terminal window and running `touch ~/.cdsapirc` to create the file and then `echo [line 1 of the code] >> ~/.cdsapirc` followed by `echo [line 2 of the code] >> ~/.cdsapirc`.  Alternatively, if you are using VSCode, you can simply open your root folder in a new window, save a new file as `.cdsapirc`, and copy paste in the CDS code.

    * For Windows, the process is slightly more complicated.  See an in-depth guide at the [Copernicus Knowledge Base here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/How+to+install+and+use+CDS+API+on+Windows).

3.  Install the CDS API client by opening a terminal/shell and running `pip3 install cdsapi`.

4.  Once you've installed the API key and the API client, you can confirm access by running an example like those from the [CDS API how-to](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to) in a Python script or a Jupyter notebook.

```
import cdsapi

c = cdsapi.Client()

c.retrieve(
    'reanalysis-era5-single-levels',
    {
        'product_type': 'reanalysis',
        'format': 'netcdf',
        'variable': [
            '2m_dewpoint_temperature', '2m_temperature',
        ],
        'year': '2011',
        'month': [
            '01',
        ],
        'day': [
            '01', '02', '03'
        ],
        'time': [
            '00:00', '12:00',
        ],
    },
    'download.nc')
```

The above example downloads 2m temperature and 2m dewpoint temperature with data points at 00:00 and 12:00 for each day, from January 1-3, 2011, in netcdf format.
