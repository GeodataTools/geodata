        **Geodata** is an `xarray`-enabled Python library of geospatial data collection and "pre-analysis" tools. Geospatial datasets of physical variables are ubiquitous, high resolution, and available in long time-series. These are typically generated as part of earth system models, but due to their geographic coverage they can also produce novel social science insights when coupled with social, economic, and political datasets. Working with these datasets often has significant startup costs due to their diverse sources, data formats, resolutions, and large file sizes.
        
        **Geodata** streamlines the collection and use of geospatial datasets through the creation of shared scripts for “analysis-ready” physical variables. Its purpose is to make it easier for researchers to identify, download, and work with new sources of geospatial data. Additionally, with a minimal amount of data consistency checks and metadata information, when one researcher goes through this exercise, everyone benefits.
        
        **Geodata** builds off the **[atlite](https://github.com/PyPSA/atlite)** library, which converts weather data (such as wind speeds, solar radiation, temperature and runoff) into power systems data (such as wind power, solar power, hydro power and heating demand time series). Atlite was developed by Gorm Andresen, Jonas Hörsch, Tom Brown, Markus Schlott, and David Schlachtberger.  To learn more about atlite and its usage, see the [atlite readme](https://github.com/PyPSA/atlite/blob/master/README.rst) or its [documentation](https://atlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html). Geodata retains the power systems data functionality of atlite.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        **Geodata** has been tested to run with python3 (>= 3.6.9). It requires a number of libraries to work with netCDF files including `xarray`, `netcdf4` and `dask`. Read the [package setup instructions](doc/general/packagesetup.md) to configure and install the package.
        
        
        ## Examples
        
        Read the [geodata documentation](doc/general/tableofcontents.md) to get started.
